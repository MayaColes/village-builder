# Village Builder (Polar Bear Game V2)

  

This is a UI-based strategy and resource management game. Collect resources and make advancements in science and magic to grow your city of bears and protect its citizens.

This is a total rewrite in Angular of my original attempt of this game --- enjoy an easy to run, Java-free experience!

2. Run 

```sh
